# Models

## Why did created this repo?

To make a realy pwerful models you need to run them on some **server** I have my own server running on _Digital Ocean_.
So I develop the model in my local enviornment and train the model on a sample of the dataset then push the code
pull it into my server and run the model as a process on the backend. This allow me to run the traning process to a long period of time. And try large number of **epochs**, **batch sizes**, apply **grid search** and use **large dataset**

> All of this to **unleash** the power of **deep leaning** and get **results**
